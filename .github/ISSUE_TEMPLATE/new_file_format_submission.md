Use the official name where known. Please capitalise each word unless the format name is stylised in some alternative way, e.g. Apple iBook.

**PUID**
if it exists already and you're providing an enhanced description.



**Extensions** 
any extensions known to be associated with the format.



**MIME/Media Type**

This should be an official Media Type, either registered and listed via the IANA or listed in official format documentation produced by the vendor. The best way to search IANA is to find in page and search for key words of the format.
