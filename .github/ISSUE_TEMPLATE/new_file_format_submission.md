Thank you for choosing to submit a new entry to PRONOM. For each submission, please include as much of the following information as possible. It's okay if you don't have everything, but please include what you can.

**Format name**

Use the official name where known. Please capitalise each word unless the format name is stylised in some alternative way, e.g. Apple iBook.

**Version number**

(where relevant)

**Extensions**

Any extensions known to be associated with the format.

**MIME/Media Type**

The MIME or Media Type associated with the format. A brief description of what a MIME type is can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types). This should be an official Media Type, either registered and listed via the IANA or listed in official format documentation produced by the vendor. The best way to search [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) is to use your browser's find in page feature and search for key words of the format.

**Description**

A concise, objective description of the file format. Format descriptions must be objective - avoid using phrases like "This is the best format for â€¦" and avoid comparisons with other formats.

**Format type**

What type of format is it? Options currently available are Audio, Database, Email, GIS, Image (Raster), Image (Vector), Page Description, Presentation, Spreadsheet, Text (Unstructured), Text (Structured), Text (Mark-up), Word Processor, Video, Aggregate, Dataset, Model and Font. Your format may not easily fit into any of these categories, so feel free to reach out for advice!

**Vendor**

Which vendor created the format? Which vendor currently supports it?

**File format identification signatures**

Useful information is a description of the byte sequence (or sequences) that identifies this format, how far from the beginning or end of file (BOF/EOF) the sequence is found and any other information that helps with unambiguous identification of this file format.

**Relevant links, documentation, extra information**

Any links to where you found your information, or anything else you think is important not yet covered.

**Credit**

We like to credit everyone who submits to PRONOM. The name by which you wish to be credited will appear in the release notes and possibly in the database too. Contributors are usually credited by organisation but you can use your name also. Of course you can choose to remain anonymous.
