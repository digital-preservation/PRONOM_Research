# World Digital Preservation Day PRONOM Hackathon (2nd - 9th November 2023)

## What is PRONOM Research Week?

PRONOM Research Week is a yearly initiative over the course of a week to help focus community effort on addressing the gaps in PRONOM and making the database better! Based on previous research weeks in 2019 and 2020, the PRONOM Team would like to announce the return of PRONOM Research Week for 2023. PRONOM Research Week is a great opportunity to get involved in contributing to PRONOM. You can read more about what PRONOM is and about our work in our [blog post](https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pronom-a-database-centenary/) which celebrated PRONOM's 100th release!

We will be holding a welcome event on [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YmE2ZWIwNWMtYmE3Zi00ZmI2LTllYTQtYmRmOGVhNTJlYmVk%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22f99512c1-fd9f-4475-9896-9a0b3cdc50ec%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22e02319b9-2b3a-4408-86ee-7cd0ba62ed9f%22%7d) at 15:30 GMT 2nd November for a short presentation, informal Q&A and a maybe some games if time!

## How do I get involved?

We want everyone to have the opportunity to get involved (if they would like to)! This year we will be running a Descriptathon (a new term maybe) alongside the traditional file format research submissions callout.

### Descriptathon

Is your skill in cataloguing and research? Amazing! For those of you who may not want to analyse the contents of files we'd still love your help. Many of the file formats in PRONOM do not have a description! They only have what we call 'Outline Descriptions'. We have set up a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-iaHhNDP2yvWZxm8R-4UDrsdBzn8EfFCjw9sdJ1AnJM/edit?usp=sharing) (so no GitHub account necessary). Full instructions are within the sheet but it's pretty simple, your description and how we can credit you can be inputted in there.

### File Format Research

For those who want to correct the signatures within PRONOM, analyse hex or submit full file formats. You may have a file format that hasn't been identifying that you wish to create a siganture for or noticed something that isn't in PRONOM. A full list of file formats in PRONOM can be found [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/All_formats_lists/pronom_formats_v108.csv) as of v.108. Stuck for inspiration? An updated list of file formats with no signatures can be found [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/formats_without_signatures/formats_without_signatures_october_2022.csv).

## Resources

This page provides useful information for anyone interested in file format research and contributing to [PRONOM: The Technical Repository](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx). We have put together resources our GitHub page to get you started in file format research or answer any questions if you get stuck. You can find much more information about our submission process and resources on [the main page of this repository](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research).

### New to file format research?

We have created this [Starter Pack](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Starter%20Guide%20(1).pdf) to make it easier for anyone to research file formats. The guide is divided into easy to follow _Ready, Set, GO!_ structure and includes a _Content page_ so whether you have researched file formats before, or you are just getting started you can easily navigate across the pages to find the most relevant information.

### Submission templates
To make your file format research easier to follow, and to make submitting to PRONOM easier, we have created two templates one in [Microsoft Word document format](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Submission%20template.docx) and other in [Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/PRONOM%20Submission%20Temple_spreadsheet.xlsx) so you can choose your preffered working document. These templates serve as a guidance only and we are always grateful to receive as little, or as a lot, information as possible.

You can also submit information regarding file formats to us using [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/pulls) which we then collect and merge into our [Submission folder for Research Week](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/tree/main/PRONOM_Research_Week/Research_Week_2022) so you can keep track of how we process your submission. You can also email us your research, our email is available in the contact information.

## Contact
We always like to hear from anyone interested in file format research! For any quidance or enquiries regarding PRONOM please email us on PRONOM@nationalarchives.gov.uk or use the [Issues page](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/issues). For the week we will be increasing the amount of drop-in sessions we usually hold. The times to join the drop-in sessions can be found [here](https://github.com/digital-preservation/PRONOM_Research/blob/main/Resources/drop-in.md).
We will also be talking about Research Week on the [28th at DPConnect with the DPC](https://www.dpconline.org/events/eventdetail/48/-/dpclinic-october-pronom-special).
