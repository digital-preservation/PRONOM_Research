# PRONOM Drop-in Sessions 

The PRONOM team would also like to share details of their PRONOM drop-in sessions. These are open/unstructured sessions with members of the PRONOM Team to talk about your current research and ask/answer any questions you may have.

Every 2 weeks at Thursday 4pm UK time or 11am (ET). The meeting link to join for these sessions can be found [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_OThkMzIwMWItYTUzYS00NDIxLTgzNTEtMzAwMGQzYWZhNmJi%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22f99512c1-fd9f-4475-9896-9a0b3cdc50ec%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22e02319b9-2b3a-4408-86ee-7cd0ba62ed9f%22%7d).
